# ubuntu-config
Dotfiles for my Ubuntu systems. All are currently running some derivative of 14.04.

Dotfiles in "shared" are read only from scripts for individual computers. The computer-specific dotfiles are then symlinked to the home directory. Nothing fancy, but feel free to use them as you please.
